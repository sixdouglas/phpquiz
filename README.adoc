= PHP Quiz

Quiz app for students

== Installation

To install all the required dependancies, you need to call composer:

 composer install

You need to run the SQL script on you Database:

 ./src/db/phpQuiz.sql

== Configuration

The config file is here:

 ./config/donfig.php

If you use **Apache** `alias` functionality, you should set your alias name in the `site` section in the file.

Then, in order to connect to your Database, you need to customize the `database` section.

== Tests

For the unit test, I'm actually using the https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.4/index.html[7.4.3 PhpUnit]

I'm only testing the routing of the application to ensure it works well.

 ./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/PhpQuiz/ApplicationTest
