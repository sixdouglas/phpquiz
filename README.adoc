= PHP Quiz

Quiz app for students

== Installation

To install all the required dependancies, you need to call composer:

 composer install

You need to run the SQL script on you Database:

 ./src/db/phpQuiz.sql

== Configuration

The config file is here:

 ./config/donfig.php

If you use **Apache** `alias` functionality, you should set your alias name in the `site` section in the file.

Then, in order to connect to your Database, you need to customize the `database` section.

== Tests

For the unit test, I'm actually using the https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.4/index.html[7.4.3 PhpUnit]

I'm only testing the routing of the application to ensure it works well.

 ./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/PhpQuiz/ApplicationTest

== Architecture

=== Big Picture

The application big picture show you that there are different layers:

- Templates
- Controllers
- Services
- Repositories
- Entities

==== Templates

They are created using the https://github.com/pug-php/pug[PUG PHP] framework.

==== Controllers

Used to retreive data from $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, call the Services and then fill the array to feed the Pug.

==== Services

Used to isolate the business logic and fetch database data through the Repositories.

==== Repositories

Data Access Abstraction of the database built using https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.6/reference/working-with-objects.html#custom-repositories[Doctrine ORM Custom Repositories].

==== Entities

Database abstraction using https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.6/reference/basic-mapping.html#basic-mapping[Doctrine ORM].

=== Remarks

The Controller path -> method association is done through https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-annotations/en/1.6/index.html[annotation processing]
